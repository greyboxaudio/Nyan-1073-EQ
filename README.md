#Poor Man’s 1073

Inspired by the Poor Man's Pultec (https://groupdiy.com/index.php?topic=43859.0) this is my take on the classic 1073 Equalizer.
The main goal of this project is to give people an affordable option for building this EQ. This is achieved by replacing all inductors with gyrators aka 'simulated inductors'.
I also want to help people gain a better understanding of the original circuit.

*	I assume that you already have a suitable power supply for this circuit. As I'm mostly playing around with Eurorack stuff, I've been using this design for a linear regulated +/-12v PSU: http://electro-music.com/forum/post-389344.html
* I’ve indicated which parts of the circuit correspond with the original 1073
*	To save space, only one example of each filter frequency has been drawn out

*	I won’t link to any original 1073 schematics, however they are easy to find, if you search for “1073 1084 user manual issue5”
*	The following article from Rod Elliott has been very helpful in understanding and implementing gyrators http://sound.whsites.net/articles/gyrator-filters.htm
*	The inductance and resistance values for the different inductors have been taken from here http://www.sowter.co.uk/eqinductors.php
*	I’ve used the Waves Scheps 73 plugin as my main reference for the frequency response https://www.waves.com/plugins/scheps-73
*	DDMF’s Plugindoctor has been a great tool for measuring and referencing my circuit with the plugin https://ddmf.eu/plugindoctor/
