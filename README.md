Poor Man’s 1073

You can find the corresponding GroupDIY topic over here: https://groupdiy.com/index.php?topic=70096.0

-	I’ve indicated which parts of the circuit correspond with the original 1073
-	To save space only one example of each filter frequency has been drawn out
-	I’ve been running the circuit on +/-12v
-	I won’t link to any original 1073 schematics, however they are easy to find, if you search for “1073 1084 user manual issue5”
-	The following article from Rod Elliott has been very helpful in understanding and implementing gyrators http://sound.whsites.net/articles/gyrator-filters.htm
-	The inductance and resistance values for the different inductors have been taken from here http://www.sowter.co.uk/eqinductors.php
-	I’ve used the Waves Scheps 73 plugin as my main reference for the frequency response https://www.waves.com/plugins/scheps-73
-	DDMF’s Plugindoctor has been a great tool for measuring and referencing my circuit with the plugin https://ddmf.eu/plugindoctor/
